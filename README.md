# C# Fundamentals by Dara Oladapo

As I start to focus on my core passion in tech-training and knowledge transfer, here is my c-sharp lessons repository on github...This is my adaptation of work and my understanding and how I know how to teach C#. Feel free to contact me for any suggestions or comments.

## Our Demo

We will be creating a C# application for a company called WindForce Corp.
Let's have some fun!

## Lesson 1

### Introducing C# and .NET

Here are the items we will be discussing.

- What is .NET
- What is C#
- Your Development Tools

## Lesson 2

### Variables and Calculations

In this lesson, we will be talking about data types, variables and do some fun things with those variables.

In the calculations, we introduce on bug as a prerequisite to our next lesson where we deal with what bugs are, how to catch, swash and avoid them (you know, some could be devastating).

## Lesson 3

### Debugging

In this lesson, we will be talking about how to locate some bugs in your code.
From our last lesson, we noticed that when we performed the snippet below, our output was 0 instead of 0.5

    int anotherDividedValue = secondValue / firstValue;
    Console.WriteLine($"{secondValue}/{firstValue}={anotherDividedValue}");

This is not supposed to be right? We call this a bug because our program is not doing what it is supposed to do.
How do we solve this? Let's look into the code and DEBUG.

Oh yeah, we introduced 2 new concepts here, CASTING and PARSING.
Since we introduced parsing. We should probably treat something omitted here-accepting values from the console-quickly.
